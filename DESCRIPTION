Description: We provide an efficient implementation for two-step multi-source transfer learning algorithms in high-dimensional generalized linear models (GLMs). The elastic-net penalized GLM with three popular families, including linear, logistic and Poisson regression models, can be fitted. To avoid negative transfer, a transferable source detection algorithm is proposed. We also provides visualization for the transferable source detection results. The details of methods can be found in "Tian, Y., & Feng, Y. (2023). Transfer learning under high-dimensional generalized linear models. Journal of the American Statistical Association, 118(544), 2684-2697.".
